## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845-common device tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).
Moved a few things to common that don't make sense to be separate, and separated a few things that don't make sense to be commonized.
Adding current OnePlus Camera & Gallery and support plumbing for that, thanks to the work of AnierinB & many other people for that.

Rebased on the official lineage-18.1 branch of the LineageOS device tree as of June 2022.
